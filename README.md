Tiny Javascript for Sortable Drag n Drop non JQuery

This is a super tiny sortable drag and drop javascript (No JQuery). The size is only 777 bytes in my computer
All you need to do is following two steps

1. include the file in your html document
2. Put this script some where in your document
	window.onload = function () {
		sortable('areaClassName', 'elementClassName');
	};

That's all...

See my demo... And I hope you don't expect too much with this tiny script (its only 777 bytes)
